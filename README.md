This repository contains code and hardware design files for an open source forward looking infrared (FLIR) thermal camera.

The thermal camera is based on a Heimann Sensor module, detailed in ```HeimannArrays9-9-16.pdf``` and the sample datasheet.

Code is in ```GUI/```, and should work out of the box on a Raspberry Pi with I2C enabled.

Models for 3D printing are in ```case/```.
